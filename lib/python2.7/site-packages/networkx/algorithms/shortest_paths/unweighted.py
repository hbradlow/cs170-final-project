    ------
    This differs from floyd_warshall only in the types of the return
    values.  Thus, path[i,j] gives the predecessor at j on a path from
    i to j.  A value of None indicates that no path exists.  A
    predecessor of i indicates the beginning of the path.  The
    advantage of this implementation is that, while running time is
    O(n^3), running space is O(n^2).
